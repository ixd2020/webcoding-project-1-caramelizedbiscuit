      Shirin started off with photography and her earliest works include the
      Unveiling (1993) and Women of Allah (1993–97) series, which explore
      notions of femininity in relation to Islamic fundamentalism and militancy
      in her home country of Iran. As Shirin was experiencing discrepancy
      between the culture and that of the pre-revolution Iran in which she was
      raised, she began her first mature body of work, the Women of Allah
      series, portraits of women entirely overlaid by Persian calligraphy.Her
      work refers to the social, cultural and religious codes of Muslim
      societies and the complexity of certain oppositions, such as man and
      woman. Neshat often emphasizes this theme showing two or more coordinated
      films concurrently, creating stark visual contrasts through motifs such as
      light and dark, black and white, male and female. Neshat has also made
      more traditional narrative short films, such as Zarin (2005).
