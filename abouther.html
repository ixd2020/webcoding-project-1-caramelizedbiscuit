    Shirin Neshat, a contemporary Iranian visual artist best known for her
    photography and films. She has broken societal norms with her works that
    speaks volume. She challenges the ideology of Muslim women being victims and
    dives deep into exile through her works. Since Iran has undermined basic
    human rights, particularly since the Islamic Revolution, Shirin felt that
    she "gravitated toward making art that is concerned with tyranny,
    dictatorship, oppression and political injustice. Shirin once said,
    <em>
      Although I don’t consider myself an activist, I believe my art –
      regardless of its nature – is an expression of protest, a cry for
      humanity.”</em

  Shirin grew up in Qavin, north-western of Iran and is the fourth of five
  children of wealthy parents. She describes her home as a "very warm,
  supportive Muslim family environment". She grew up learning traditional
  religious values through her maternal grandparents. Furthermore, when she got
  older, she was enrolled in a Catholic boarding school in Tehran. She was
  surrounded and influenced by western feminism, as her father encouraged each
  of his daughters to "be an individual, to take risks, to learn, to see the
  world". Shirin's father sent his daughters as well as his sons to college to
  receive higher education

  In 1975, Shirin left her hometown to study art at UC Berkeley and completed
  her BA, MA and MFA. She soon then graduated from UC Berkeley in 1983, and
  moved to New York City. However, while she was there she was quick to realise
  that making art wasn't going to be her full time profession at that point of
  time. Additionally, after meeting her future husband, who ran the Storefront
  for Art and Architecture, an alternative space in Manhattan, she decidedto
  dedicate ten years of her life to working with him there, as a second
  education. Her works are included in the collections of the Tate Gallery in
  London, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, and
  the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.
